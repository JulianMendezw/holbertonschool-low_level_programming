**man or help**:

-   `ascii`  (_You do not need to learn about  `scanf`,  `getc`,  `getchar`,  `EOF`,  `EXIT_SUCCESS`,  `time`,  `rand`,  `srand`,  `RAND_MAX`,  `for`  loops,  `do...while`  loops, functions._)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to  [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/ZINxoF_40ehsu7vI2nx1qQ "explain to anyone"),  **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
-   What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
-   What the the relational operators and how to use them
-   What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
-   What are the boolean operators and how to use them
-   How to use the  `if`,  `if ... else`  statements
-   How to use comments
-   How to declare variables of types  `char`,  `int`,  `unsigned int`
-   How to assign values to variables
-   How to print the values of variables of type  `char`,  `int`,  `unsigned int`  with  `printf`
-   How to use the  `while`  loop
-   How to use variables with the  `while`  loop
-   How to print variables using  `printf`
-   What is the  `ASCII`  character set
-   What are the purpose of the  `gcc`  flags  `-m32`  and  `-m64`

## Requirements

### General

-   Allowed editors:  `vi`,  `vim`,  `emacs`
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   Your programs and functions will compiled with  `gcc 4.8.4`  using the flags  `-Wall`  `-Werror`  `-Wextra`  `and -pedantic`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project
-   There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
-   You are not allowed to use  `system`
-   Your code should use the  `Betty`  style. It will be checked using  [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl")  and  [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
